314 First Street, Harbor View Café
The oldest part of this building dates back to the nineteenth
century. There was an inn on this corner as early as the 1850s,
but early accounts suggest that the original building was
replaced in the 1890s.
In the next block, along the lakeshore, were the general store
of Patrick McInerney and the residence and livery stable of
the P.N. Tuttle family.
