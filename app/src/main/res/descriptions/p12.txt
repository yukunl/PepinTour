506 First Street, Private Residence
This house was built as a family home by C.D. Nehlson, a
German farmer, cabinetmaker-house builder, and partner with
Fred Stahl in the grain elevator business.
There were some improvements (taxable structures) on the
lakeshore opposite this block, but the Stahl elevator was not
built there until after Laura’s time.
On the lakeshore west of the corner of First and Pine Streets
was the Richards Brothers’ General Store, which was
purchased by H.J. Milliron in 1874.
