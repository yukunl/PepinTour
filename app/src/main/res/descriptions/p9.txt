404 First Street, 404 Coffee Shop
In Laura’s time, A.D. Gray, a prominent businessman from
Pennsylvania, owned this entire quarter block, as well as
number 7 and the mill property down at the point. This
building was his family home and was set back from the
sidewalk. It was moved to its present location in 1886 to
make room for buildings that were being moved from the
railroad right of way.
