310 First Street, Dockside Pub
This building belonged to Barbara Moore through the 1870s.
Newspapers of the late 1850s referred to “Moore’s Hall.” Family tradition is that Mrs. Moore, Civil War Widow,
rented the building to various shopkeepers. In the early
1880s, Mrs. Moore sold the building to James Hallsworth,
who ran a hardware store there for many years.
