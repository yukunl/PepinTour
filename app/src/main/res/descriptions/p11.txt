410 First Street, Private Residence
Henry Sinjen came to Pepin and established a shoe and
harness business at this location in the late 1870s. When
Laura came to Pepin, this property and the entire SW quarter
of the block belonged to Fred Stahl, originally from
Germany, another of Pepin’s prominent businessmen.
William Boyd Newcomb built the first cabin in the village in
the next block at the corner of First and Pine. It was
soon replaced by a more substantial residence at Second and
Cedar. In Laura’s time, the block contained several small commercial
buildings: the John Lowry cabinet shop, the Hi Fuller machine
shop, the masonic Lodge with rental space below, and the
Lyman Fuller blacksmith shop. A large hotel was built about
1880 and called at different times the Central House, the Park
Hotel, and finally the Pepin Hotel, burned in 1984.
