304 Second Street, Private Residence
This was the family home of Benjamin Allen, an attorney
and Civil War Colonel from Vermont, who was one of
Pepin’s early developers. The portion of his house that can
be seen today was built in 1857. An older wing was
demolished in the 1970s. The house was purchased in 1876
by the Philip Pfaff family
